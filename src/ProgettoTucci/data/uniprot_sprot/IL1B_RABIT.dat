CC   -!- FUNCTION: Potent proinflammatory cytokine. Initially discovered as the
CC       major endogenous pyrogen, induces prostaglandin synthesis, neutrophil
CC       influx and activation, T-cell activation and cytokine production, B-
CC       cell activation and antibody production, and fibroblast proliferation
CC       and collagen production. Promotes Th17 differentiation of T-cells.
CC       Synergizes with IL12/interleukin-12 to induce IFNG synthesis from T-
CC       helper 1 (Th1) cells. Plays a role in angiogenesis by inducing VEGF
CC       production synergistically with TNF and IL6.
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P01584}.
CC   -!- SUBUNIT: Monomer. In its precursor form, weakly interacts with full-
CC       length MEFV; the mature cytokine does not interact at all. Interacts
CC       with integrins ITGAV:ITGBV and ITGA5:ITGB1; integrin-binding is
CC       required for IL1B signaling. Interacts with cargo receptor TMED10; the
CC       interaction is direct and is required for the secretion of IL1B mature
CC       form. Interacts with HSP90AB1; the interaction facilitates cargo
CC       translocation into the ERGIC. Interacts with HSP90B1; the interaction
CC       facilitates cargo translocation into the ERGIC.
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P01584}.
CC   -!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytosol
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P01584}. Lysosome
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P01584}. Secreted, extracellular exosome
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P10749}. Secreted
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P01584}. Note=The precursor is cytosolic. In
CC       response to inflammasome-activating signals, such as ATP for NLRP3
CC       inflammasome or bacterial flagellin for NLRC4 inflammasome, cleaved and
CC       secreted. IL1B lacks any known signal sequence and the pathway(s) of
CC       its secretion is(are) not yet fully understood. On the basis of
CC       experimental results, several unconventional secretion mechanisms have
CC       been proposed. 1. Secretion via secretory lysosomes: a fraction of
CC       CASP1 and IL1B precursor may be incorporated, by a yet undefined
CC       mechanism, into secretory lysosomes that undergo Ca(2+)-dependent
CC       exocytosis with release of mature IL1B. 2. Secretory autophagy: IL1B-
CC       containing autophagosomes may fuse with endosomes or multivesicular
CC       bodies (MVBs) and then merge with the plasma membrane releasing soluble
CC       IL1B or IL1B-containing exosomes (By similarity). However, autophagy
CC       impacts IL1B production at several levels and its role in secretion is
CC       still controversial. 3. Secretion via exosomes: ATP-activation of P2RX7
CC       leads to the formation of MVBs containing exosomes with entrapped IL1B,
CC       CASP1 and other inflammasome components. These MVBs undergo exocytosis
CC       with the release of exosomes. The release of soluble IL1B occurs after
CC       the lysis of exosome membranes (By similarity). 4. Secretion by
CC       microvesicle shedding: activation of the ATP receptor P2RX7 may induce
CC       an immediate shedding of membrane-derived microvesicles containing IL1B
CC       and possibly inflammasome components. The cytokine is then released in
CC       the extracellular compartment after microvesicle lysis (By similarity).
CC       5. Release by translocation through permeabilized plasma membrane. This
CC       may occur in cells undergoing pyroptosis due to sustained activation of
CC       the inflammasome (By similarity). 6. The secretion is dependent on
CC       protein unfolding and facilitated by the cargo receptor TMED10; it
CC       results in the protein translocation from the cytoplasm into the ERGIC
CC       (endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment) followed by
CC       vesicle entry and secretion, and enhanced by chaperones HSP90AB1 and
CC       HSP90B1/GRP9. These mechanisms may not be mutually exclusive (By
CC       similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P01584,
CC       ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P10749}.
CC   -!- MISCELLANEOUS: IL1B production occurs in 2 steps, each being controlled
CC       by different stimuli. First, inflammatory signals, such as LPS,
CC       stimulate the synthesis and promote the accumulation of cytosolic
CC       stores of pro-IL1B (priming). Then additional signals are required for
CC       inflammasome assembly, leading to CASP1 activation, pro-IL1B processing
CC       and eventually secretion of the active cytokine. IL1B processing and
CC       secretion are temporarily associated. {ECO:0000250}.
CC   -!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the IL-1 family. {ECO:0000305}.
