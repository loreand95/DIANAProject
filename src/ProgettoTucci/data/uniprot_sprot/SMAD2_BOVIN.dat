CC   -!- FUNCTION: Receptor-regulated SMAD (R-SMAD) that is an intracellular
CC       signal transducer and transcriptional modulator activated by TGF-beta
CC       (transforming growth factor) and activin type 1 receptor kinases. Binds
CC       the TRE element in the promoter region of many genes that are regulated
CC       by TGF-beta and, on formation of the SMAD2/SMAD4 complex, activates
CC       transcription. May act as a tumor suppressor in colorectal carcinoma.
CC       Positively regulates PDPK1 kinase activity by stimulating its
CC       dissociation from the 14-3-3 protein YWHAQ which acts as a negative
CC       regulator (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q15796,
CC       ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q62432}.
CC   -!- SUBUNIT: Monomer; in the absence of TGF-beta (By similarity).
CC       Heterodimer; in the presence of TGF-beta (By similarity). Forms a
CC       heterodimer with co-SMAD, SMAD4, in the nucleus to form the
CC       transactivation complex SMAD2/SMAD4 (By similarity). Found in a complex
CC       with SMAD3 and TRIM33 upon addition of TGF-beta (By similarity).
CC       Identified in a complex that contains at least ZNF451, SMAD2, SMAD3 and
CC       SMAD4 (By similarity). Interacts (via the MH2 domain) with ZFYVE9; may
CC       form trimers with the SMAD4 co-SMAD (By similarity). Interacts with
CC       TAZ/WWRT1 (By similarity). Interacts with FOXH1 (By similarity).
CC       Interacts with SNW1 (By similarity). Interacts with CREB-binding
CC       protein (CBP) and EP300 (By similarity). Interacts with SNON (By
CC       similarity). Interacts with ALK4/ACVR1B (By similarity). Interacts with
CC       SKOR1 (By similarity). Interacts with SKOR2 (By similarity). Interacts
CC       with PRDM16 (By similarity). Interacts (via MH2 domain) with LEMD3 (By
CC       similarity). Interacts with RBPMS (By similarity). Interacts with WWP1.
CC       Interacts (dephosphorylated form, via the MH1 and MH2 domains) with
CC       RANBP3 (via its C-terminal R domain); the interaction results in the
CC       export of dephosphorylated SMAD3 out of the nucleus and termination of
CC       the TGF-beta signaling (By similarity). Interacts with PDPK1 (via PH
CC       domain) (By similarity). Interacts with DAB2; the interactions are
CC       enhanced upon TGF-beta stimulation (By similarity). Interacts with
CC       USP15 (By similarity). Interacts with PPP5C (By similarity). Interacts
CC       with LDLRAD4 (via the SMAD interaction motif) (By similarity).
CC       Interacts (via MH2 domain) with PMEPA1 (via the SMAD interaction motif)
CC       (By similarity). Interacts with ZFHX3 (By similarity). Interacts with
CC       ZNF451 (By similarity). Interacts with SMURF2 when phosphorylated on
CC       Ser-465/467 (By similarity). Interacts with PPM1A (By similarity).
CC       Interacts with TGF-beta (By similarity). Interacts with TGFBR1 (By
CC       similarity). Interacts with TGIF (By similarity). Interacts with SMAD3
CC       and TRIM33 (By similarity). Interacts with ZNF580 (By similarity).
CC       Interacts with NEDD4L in response to TGF-beta (By similarity).
CC       Interacts with HGS (By similarity). Interacts with AIP1 (By
CC       similarity). Interacts with WWP1 (By similarity). Interacts with PML
CC       (By similarity). Interacts weakly with ZNF8 (By similarity). Interacts
CC       (when phosphorylated) with RNF111; RNF111 acts as an enhancer of the
CC       transcriptional responses by mediating ubiquitination and degradation
CC       of SMAD2 inhibitors (By similarity). Interacts with YAP1 (when
CC       phosphorylated at 'Ser-55') (By similarity).
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q15796, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q62432}.
CC   -!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q15796}. Nucleus
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q15796}. Note=Cytoplasmic and nuclear in the
CC       absence of TGF-beta (By similarity). On TGF-beta stimulation, migrates
CC       to the nucleus when complexed with SMAD4 (By similarity). On
CC       dephosphorylation by phosphatase PPM1A, released from the SMAD2/SMAD4
CC       complex, and exported out of the nucleus by interaction with RANBP1 (By
CC       similarity). Localized mainly to the nucleus in the early stages of
CC       embryo development with expression becoming evident in the cytoplasm at
CC       the blastocyst and epiblast stages (By similarity).
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q15796, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q62432}.
CC   -!- PTM: In response to TGF-beta, phosphorylated on the C-terminal SXS
CC       motif by TGF-beta and activin type 1 receptor kinases, phosphorylation
CC       declines progressively in a KMT5A-dependent manner. Phosphorylation in
CC       this motif is required for interaction with a number of proteins
CC       including SMURF2, SNON and SMAD4 in response to TGF-beta.
CC       Dephosphorylated in this motif by PPM1A leading to disruption of the
CC       SMAD2/3-SMAD4 complex, nuclear export and termination of the TGF-beta
CC       signaling. In response to decorin, the naturally occurring inhibitor of
CC       TGF-beta signaling, phosphorylated on Ser-240 by CaMK2. Phosphorylated
CC       by MAPK3 upon EGF stimulation; which increases transcriptional activity
CC       and stability, and is blocked by calmodulin. Phosphorylated by PDPK1
CC       (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q15796}.
CC   -!- PTM: Acetylated on Lys-19 by coactivators in response to TGF-beta
CC       signaling, which increases transcriptional activity.
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q15796}.
CC   -!- PTM: In response to TGF-beta, ubiquitinated by NEDD4L; which promotes
CC       its degradation. Monoubiquitinated, leading to prevent DNA-binding (By
CC       similarity). Deubiquitination by USP15 alleviates inhibition and
CC       promotes activation of TGF-beta target genes (By similarity).
CC       Ubiquitinated by RNF111, leading to its degradation: only SMAD2
CC       proteins that are 'in use' are targeted by RNF111, RNF111 playing a key
CC       role in activating SMAD2 and regulating its turnover (By similarity).
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q15796, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q62432}.
CC   -!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the dwarfin/SMAD family. {ECO:0000305}.
