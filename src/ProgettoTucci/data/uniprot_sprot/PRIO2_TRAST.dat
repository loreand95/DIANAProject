CC   -!- FUNCTION: Its primary physiological function is unclear. Has
CC       cytoprotective activity against internal or environmental stresses. May
CC       play a role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. May be
CC       required for neuronal myelin sheath maintenance. May play a role in
CC       iron uptake and iron homeostasis. Soluble oligomers are toxic to
CC       cultured neuroblastoma cells and induce apoptosis (in vitro).
CC       Association with GPC1 (via its heparan sulfate chains) targets PRNP to
CC       lipid rafts. Also provides Cu(2+) or ZN(2+) for the ascorbate-mediated
CC       GPC1 deaminase degradation of its heparan sulfate side chains (By
CC       similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P04156,
CC       ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P04925}.
CC   -!- SUBUNIT: Monomer and homodimer. Has a tendency to aggregate into
CC       amyloid fibrils containing a cross-beta spine, formed by a steric
CC       zipper of superposed beta-strands. Soluble oligomers may represent an
CC       intermediate stage on the path to fibril formation. Copper binding may
CC       promote oligomerization. Interacts with GRB2, APP, ERI3/PRNPIP and
CC       SYN1. Mislocalized cytosolically exposed PrP interacts with MGRN1; this
CC       interaction alters MGRN1 subcellular location and causes lysosomal
CC       enlargement. Interacts with KIAA1191. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P04156,
CC       ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P04925}.
CC   -!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P04156};
CC       Lipid-anchor, GPI-anchor {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P04156}. Golgi
CC       apparatus {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P04925}. Note=Targeted to lipid rafts
CC       via association with the heparan sulfate chains of GPC1. Colocates, in
CC       the presence of Cu(2+), to vesicles in para- and perinuclear regions,
CC       where both proteins undergo internalization. Heparin displaces PRNP
CC       from lipid rafts and promotes endocytosis.
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P04156}.
CC   -!- DOMAIN: The normal, monomeric form has a mainly alpha-helical
CC       structure. The disease-associated, protease-resistant form forms
CC       amyloid fibrils containing a cross-beta spine, formed by a steric
CC       zipper of superposed beta-strands. Disease mutations may favor
CC       intermolecular contacts via short beta strands, and may thereby trigger
CC       oligomerization. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P04156}.
CC   -!- DOMAIN: Contains an N-terminal region composed of octamer repeats. At
CC       low copper concentrations, the sidechains of His residues from three or
CC       four repeats contribute to the binding of a single copper ion.
CC       Alternatively, a copper ion can be bound by interaction with the
CC       sidechain and backbone amide nitrogen of a single His residue. The
CC       observed copper binding stoichiometry suggests that two repeat regions
CC       cooperate to stabilize the binding of a single copper ion. At higher
CC       copper concentrations, each octamer can bind one copper ion by
CC       interactions with the His sidechain and Gly backbone atoms. A mixture
CC       of binding types may occur, especially in the case of octamer repeat
CC       expansion. Copper binding may stabilize the conformation of this region
CC       and may promote oligomerization. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P04156}.
CC   -!- DISEASE: Note=Variations in PRNP are responsible of transmissible
CC       bovine spongiform encephalopathies (BSE), a class of neurodegenerative
CC       diseases that affect various mammals. These diseases are caused by
CC       abnormally folded prion proteins. BSE can be subdivided into at least
CC       three groups: classical, H-type and L-type, with the latter 2
CC       collectively referred to as atypical BSE. Susceptibility or resistance
CC       to a BSE disease can be influenced by at least 3 factors related to the
CC       host prion protein: protein expression levels, number of octapeptide
CC       repeats, and specific polymorphisms. In cattle, as in humans, BSEs can
CC       occur as infectious, spontaneous and genetic diseases. {ECO:0000305}.
CC   -!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prion family. {ECO:0000305}.
