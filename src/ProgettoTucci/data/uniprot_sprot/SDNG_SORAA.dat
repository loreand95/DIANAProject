CC   -!- FUNCTION: Part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of
CC       sordarin and hypoxysordarin, glycoside antibiotics with a unique
CC       tetracyclic diterpene aglycone structure (PubMed:27072286). First, the
CC       geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase sdnC constructs GGDP from farnesyl
CC       diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate (PubMed:27072286). The
CC       diterpene cyclase sdnA then catalyzes the cyclization of GGDP to afford
CC       cycloaraneosene (PubMed:27072286). Cycloaraneosene is then hydroxylated
CC       four times by the putative cytochrome P450 monooxygenases sdnB, sdnE,
CC       sdnF and sdnH to give a hydroxylated cycloaraneosene derivative such as
CC       cycloaraneosene-8,9,13,19-tetraol (PubMed:27072286). Although the order
CC       of the hydroxylations is unclear, at least C8, C9 and C13 of the
CC       cycloaraneosene skeleton are hydroxylated before the sordaricin
CC       formation (PubMed:27072286). Dehydration of the 13-hydroxy group of the
CC       hydroxylated cycloaraneosene derivative might be catalyzed by an
CC       unassigned hypothetical protein such as sdnG and sdnP to construct the
CC       cyclopentadiene moiety (PubMed:27072286). The FAD-dependent
CC       oxidoreductase sdnN is proposed to catalyze the oxidation at C9 of the
CC       hydroxylated cycloaraneosene derivative and also catalyze the Baeyer-
CC       Villiger oxidation to give the lactone intermediate (PubMed:27072286).
CC       The presumed lactone intermediate would be hydrolyzed to give an
CC       acrolein moiety and a carboxylate moiety (PubMed:27072286). Then,
CC       [4+2]cycloaddition would occur between the acrolein moiety and the
CC       cyclopentadiene moiety to give sordaricin (PubMed:27072286). SdnN might
CC       also be involved in the [4+2]cycloaddition after the hypothesized
CC       oxidation to accommodate the oxidized product and prompt the
CC       [4+2]cycloaddition (PubMed:27072286). GDP-6-deoxy-D-altrose may be
CC       biosynthesized from GDP-D-mannose by the putative GDP-mannose-4,6-
CC       dehydratase sdnI and the short-chain dehydrogenase sdnK
CC       (PubMed:27072286). The glycosyltransferase sdnJ catalyzes the
CC       attachment of 6-deoxy-D-altrose onto the 19-hydroxy group of sordaricin
CC       to give 4'-O-demethylsordarin (PubMed:27072286). The methyltransferase
CC       sdnD would complete the biosynthesis of sordarin (PubMed:27072286).
CC       Sordarin can be further modified into hypoxysordarin (PubMed:27072286).
CC       The unique acyl chain at the 3'-hydroxy group of hypoxysordarin would
CC       be constructed by an iterative type I PKS sdnO and the trans-acting
CC       polyketide methyltransferase sdnL. SdnL would be responsible for the
CC       introduction of an alpha-methyl group of the polyketide chain
CC       (PubMed:27072286). Alternatively, the beta-lactamase-like protein sdnR
CC       might be responsible for the cleavage and transfer of the polyketide
CC       chain from the PKS sdnO to sordarin (PubMed:27072286). Two putative
CC       cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, sdnQ and sdnT, might catalyze the
CC       epoxidations of the polyketide chain to complete the biosynthesis of
CC       hypoxysordarin (PubMed:27072286). Transcriptional regulators sdnM and
CC       sdnS are presumably encoded for the transcriptional regulation of the
CC       expression of the sdn gene cluster (PubMed:27072286).
