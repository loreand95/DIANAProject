CC   -!- FUNCTION: Associates with EBI3 to form the IL-27 interleukin, a
CC       heterodimeric cytokine which functions in innate immunity. Cytokine
CC       with pro- and anti-inflammatory properties, that can regulate T-helper
CC       cell development, suppress T-cell proliferation, stimulate cytotoxic T-
CC       cell activity, induce isotype switching in B-cells, and that has
CC       diverse effects on innate immune cells. Among its target cells are CD4
CC       T-helper cells which can differentiate in type 1 effector cells (TH1),
CC       type 2 effector cells (TH2) and IL17 producing helper T-cells (TH17).
CC       It drives rapid clonal expansion of naive but not memory CD4 T-cells.
CC       It also strongly synergizes with IL-12 to trigger interferon-gamma/IFN-
CC       gamma production of naive CD4 T-cells, binds to the cytokine receptor
CC       WSX-1/TCCR which appears to be required but not sufficient for IL-27-
CC       mediated signal transduction. IL-27 potentiate the early phase of TH1
CC       response and suppress TH2 and TH17 differentiation. It induces the
CC       differentiation of TH1 cells via two distinct pathways, p38
CC       MAPK/TBX21- and ICAM1/ITGAL/ERK-dependent pathways. It also induces
CC       STAT1, STAT3, STAT4 and STAT5 phosphorylation and activates TBX21/T-Bet
CC       via STAT1 with resulting IL12RB2 up-regulation, an event crucial to TH1
CC       cell commitment. It suppresses the expression of GATA3, the inhibitor
CC       TH1 cells development. In CD8 T-cells, it activates STATs as well as
CC       GZMB. IL-27 reveals to be a potent inhibitor of TH17 cell development
CC       and of IL-17 production. Indeed IL27 alone is also able to inhibit the
CC       production of IL17 by CD4 and CD8 T-cells. While IL-27 suppressed the
CC       development of proinflammatory Th17 cells via STAT1, it inhibits the
CC       development of anti-inflammatory inducible regulatory T-cells, iTreg,
CC       independently of STAT1. IL-27 has also an effect on cytokine
CC       production, it suppresses proinflammatory cytokine production such as
CC       IL2, IL4, IL5 and IL6 and activates suppressors of cytokine signaling
CC       such as SOCS1 and SOCS3. Apart from suppression of cytokine production,
CC       IL-27 also antagonizes the effects of some cytokines such as IL6
CC       through direct effects on T-cells. Another important role of IL-27 is
CC       its antitumor activity as well as its antiangiogenic activity with
CC       activation of production of antiangiogenic chemokines such as IP-
CC       10/CXCL10 and MIG/CXCL9. In vein endothelial cells, it induces
CC       IRF1/interferon regulatory factor 1 and increase the expression of MHC
CC       class II transactivator/CIITA with resulting up-regulation of major
CC       histocompatibility complex class II (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.
CC   -!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer with EBI3; not disulfide-linked. This heterodimer
CC       is known as interleukin IL-27 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.
CC   -!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted {ECO:0000250}. Note=Does not seem to be
CC       secreted without coexpression of EBI3. {ECO:0000250}.
CC   -!- PTM: O-glycosylated. {ECO:0000250}.
CC   -!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the IL-6 superfamily. {ECO:0000305}.
