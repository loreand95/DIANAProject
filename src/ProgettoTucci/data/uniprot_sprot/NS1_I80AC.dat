CC   -!- FUNCTION: Prevents the establishment of the cellular antiviral state by
CC       inhibiting TRIM25-mediated DDX58 ubiquitination, which normally
CC       triggers the antiviral transduction signal that leads to the activation
CC       of type I IFN genes by transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7. Prevents
CC       human EIF2AK2/PKR activation, either by binding double-strand RNA, or
CC       by interacting directly with EIF2AK2/PKR. This function may be
CC       important at the very beginning of the infection, when NS1 is mainly
CC       present in the cytoplasm. Also binds poly(A) and U6 snRNA.
CC       {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04066}.
CC   -!- FUNCTION: Inhibits post-transcriptional processing of cellular pre-
CC       mRNA, by binding and inhibiting two cellular proteins that are required
CC       for the 3'-end processing of cellular pre-mRNAs: the 30 kDa cleavage
CC       and polyadenylation specificity factor/CPSF4 and the poly(A)-binding
CC       protein 2/PABPN1. In turn, unprocessed 3' end pre-mRNAs accumulate in
CC       the host nucleus and are no longer exported to the cytoplasm. Cellular
CC       protein synthesis is thereby shut off very early after virus infection.
CC       Viral protein synthesis is not affected by the inhibition of the
CC       cellular 3' end processing machinery because the poly(A) tails of viral
CC       mRNAs are produced by the viral polymerase through a stuttering
CC       mechanism. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04066}.
CC   -!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer. Interacts with host TRIM25 (via coiled coil); this
CC       interaction specifically inhibits TRIM25 multimerization and TRIM25-
CC       mediated DDX58 CARD ubiquitination. Interacts with human EIF2AK2/PKR,
CC       CPSF4, IVNS1ABP and PABPN1. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04066}.
CC   -!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Host nucleus {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04066}.
CC       Host cytoplasm {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04066}. Note=In uninfected,
CC       transfected cells, NS1 is localized in the nucleus. Only in virus
CC       infected cells, the nuclear export signal is unveiled, presumably by a
CC       viral protein, and a fraction of NS1 is exported in the cytoplasm.
CC       {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04066}.
CC   -!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
CC       Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
CC       Name=NS1;
CC         IsoId=O57306-1; Sequence=Displayed;
CC       Name=NEP; Synonyms=NS2;
CC         IsoId=P69265-1; Sequence=External;
CC   -!- DOMAIN: The dsRNA-binding region is required for suppression of RNA
CC       silencing. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04066}.
CC   -!- PTM: Upon interferon induction, ISGylated via host HERC5; this results
CC       in the impairment of NS1 interaction with RNA targets due to its
CC       inability to form homodimers and to interact with host EIF2AK2/PKR.
CC       {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04066}.
CC   -!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the influenza A viruses NS1 family.
CC       {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04066}.
