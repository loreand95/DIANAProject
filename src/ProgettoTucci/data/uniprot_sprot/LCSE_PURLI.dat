CC   -!- FUNCTION: Probable thioesterase; part of the gene cluster that mediates
CC       the biosynthesis of the lipopeptide antibiotics leucinostatins that
CC       show extensive biological activities, including antimalarial,
CC       antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and antitumor activities, as well
CC       as phytotoxic (PubMed:27416025). Leucinostatin A contains nine amino
CC       acid residues, including the unusual amino acid 4-methyl-L-proline
CC       (MePro), 2-amino-6-hydroxy-4-methyl-8-oxodecanoic acid (AHyMeOA), 3-
CC       hydroxyleucine (HyLeu), alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB), beta-Ala, a
CC       4-methylhex-2-enoic acid at the N-terminus as well as a N1,N1-
CC       dimethylpropane-1,2-diamine (DPD) at the C-terminus (Probable). The
CC       biosynthesis of leucinostatins is probably initiated with the assembly
CC       of 4-methylhex-2-enoic acid by a reducing PKS. Two reducing polyketide
CC       synthases, lcsB and lcsC, have been identified in the cluster and it is
CC       not clear which is the one that assembles 4-methylhex-2-enoic acid
CC       since both contain KS, AT, DH, cMT, ER, KR and ACP domains (Probable).
CC       The polyketide residue might be transferred to the NRPS lcsA, mediated
CC       by two additional enzymes, the acyl-CoA ligase lcsD and the
CC       thioesterase lcsE. The linear polyketide carboxylic acid, which is
CC       released from PKS, is converted to a CoA thioester by lcsD, and then
CC       lcsE hydrolyzes the thiol bond and shuttles the polyketide intermediate
CC       to lcsA (Probable). The C domain of the first module catalyzed the
CC       condensation of 4-methylhex-2-enoic acid and MePro carried by domain
CC       A1, followed by successive condensations of nine amino acids to trigger
CC       the elongation of the linear peptide. A5 and A6 domains of lcsA are
CC       proposed to incorporate leucine, A2 AHyMeOA, and A3 incorporates HyLeu.
CC       A4, A7 and A8 incorporate AIB (Probable). The AHyMeOA in leucinostatin
CC       A activated by the A2 might be produced by the second PKS (lcsB or
CC       lcsC) present within the cluster (Probable). The MePro is probably
CC       produced via leucine cyclization and may originate from a separate
CC       pathway, independent of the cluster. Another nonproteinogenic amino
CC       acid, beta-Ala, could be produced by an aspartic acid decarboxylase
CC       also localized outside of the cluster. Two candidates are VFPBJ_01400
CC       and VFPBJ_10476 (Probable). The final peptide scaffold may be released
CC       by the NAD(P)H-dependent thioester reductase (TE) at the C-terminal
CC       region of lcsA (Probable). Transamination of the lcsA product by the
CC       transaminase lcsP may produce DPD at the C-terminus (Probable). Further
CC       hydroxylation steps performed alternatively by the cytochrome P450
CC       monooxygenases lcsI, lcsK and lcsN then yield the non-methylated
CC       leucinostatins precursor. It is also possible that leucines can be
CC       hydroxylated prior to their incorporation into the peptide (Probable).
CC       Varying extents of methylation then lead to the formation of
CC       leucinostatins A and B (Probable). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:27416025,
CC       ECO:0000305|PubMed:27416025}.
CC   -!- PATHWAY: Secondary metabolite biosynthesis.
CC       {ECO:0000305|PubMed:27416025}.
CC   -!- INDUCTION: Expression is positively regulated by the leucinostatins
CC       biosynthesis cluster-specific transcription regulator lcsF.
CC       {ECO:0000269|PubMed:27416025}.
CC   -!- DISRUPTION PHENOTYPE: Abolishes the production of leucinostatins A and
CC       B. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:27416025}.
CC   -!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the AMT4 thioesterase family. {ECO:0000305}.
