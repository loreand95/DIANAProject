CC   -!- FUNCTION: Major capsid protein that self-associates to form penton base
CC       pentamers, each in the shape of a pentagon, situated at the 12 vertices
CC       of the pseudo T=25 capsid. Involved in virus secondary attachment to
CC       host cell after initial attachment by the fiber protein, and in
CC       endocytosis of virions. As the virus enters the host cell, penton
CC       proteins are shed concomitant with virion acidification in the endosome
CC       (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.
CC   -!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with the fiber protein (via N-terminal tail region).
CC       Interacts with the capsid vertex protein; this interaction binds the
CC       penton base to neighboring peripentonal hexons (By similarity).
CC       {ECO:0000250}.
CC   -!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Virion {ECO:0000250}. Host nucleus {ECO:0000250}.
CC       Note=Located at each vertex of the virion. {ECO:0000250}.
CC   -!- INDUCTION: Expressed in the late phase of the viral replicative cycle.
CC   -!- MISCELLANEOUS: All late proteins expressed from the major late promoter
CC       are produced by alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation of
CC       the same gene giving rise to non-overlapping ORFs. A leader sequence is
CC       present in the N-terminus of all these mRNAs and is recognized by the
CC       viral shutoff protein to provide expression although conventional
CC       translation via ribosome scanning from the cap has been shut off in the
CC       host cell (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.
CC   -!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the adenoviridae penton family. {ECO:0000305}.
