CC   -!- FUNCTION: Plays essential roles in viral nuclear egress to mediate
CC       capsid transit across the nuclear membrane and also in the inhibition
CC       of host immune response. Facilitates nuclear egress cooperatively with
CC       host C1QBP and protein kinase C/PKC to induce lamin A/C phosphorylation
CC       and subsequent reorganization. In turn, lamina disassembles and nuclear
CC       egress occurs. Recruits the serine/threonine protein phosphatase
CC       PPP1CA/PP1-alpha to dephosphorylate the translation initiation factor
CC       eIF-2A, thereby couteracting the host shutoff of protein synthesis
CC       involving double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase EIF2AK2/PKR. In
CC       turn, controls host IRF3 activation and subsequently inhibits host
CC       interferon response. Controls the DNA sensing pathway by interacting
CC       with and inhibiting host STING/TMEM173. Also down-modulates the host
CC       MHC class II proteins cell surface expression. Acts as a neurovirulence
CC       factor that has a profound effect on the growth of the virus in central
CC       nervous system tissue, by interqcting with host BECN1 and thereby
CC       antagonizing the host autophagy response.
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P36313}.
CC   -!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with human PPP1CA to form a high-molecular-weight
CC       complex that dephosphorylates eIF2-alpha (By similarity). Binds to
CC       proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which may release host cells
CC       from growth arrest and facilitate viral replication. Interacts (via N-
CC       terminus) with host C1QBP and PRKCA. Interacts with protein UL31.
CC       Interacts with host TBK1. Interacts with host STING/TMEM173; this
CC       interaction inhibits the intracellular DNA sensing pathway. Interacts
CC       with host BECN1; this interaction modulates host autophagy (By
CC       similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08353,
CC       ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P36313}.
CC   -!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Host cytoplasm {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08353}.
CC       Host nucleus {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08353}. Host nucleus, host
CC       nucleolus {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08353}. Virion
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08353}. Note=At early times in infection,
CC       colocalizes with PCNA and replication proteins in the host cell
CC       nucleus, before accumulating in the host cytoplasm by 8 to 12 hours
CC       post-infection. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08353}.
CC   -!- DOMAIN: The triplet repeats region may play a role in modulating virus
CC       egress. {ECO:0000250}.
CC   -!- MISCELLANEOUS: ICP34.5 is detected as early as 3 hpi prior to viral
CC       replication but reaches maximal levels late in infection. ICP34.5 gene
CC       is therefore classified as gamma-1 or leaky late gene (By similarity).
CC       {ECO:0000250}.
CC   -!- MISCELLANEOUS: The phosphatase activity of the ICP34.5-PP1 complex
CC       toward EIF2S1 is specifically inhibited by Salubrinal, which inhibits
CC       viral replication. {ECO:0000250}.
CC   -!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PPP1R15 family. {ECO:0000305}.
