CC   -!- FUNCTION: Transcriptional activator which forms a core component of the
CC       circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system,
CC       regulates various physiological processes through the generation of
CC       approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are
CC       translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from
CC       the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an
CC       important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions
CC       including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure,
CC       endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two
CC       major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic
CC       nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present
CC       in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and
CC       peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as
CC       Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the
CC       central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly
CC       to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through
CC       neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related
CC       cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian
CC       rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its
CC       environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to
CC       create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when
CC       a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the
CC       solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components
CC       (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and
CC       CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays
CC       imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for
CC       determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period
CC       of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A
CC       diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the
CC       ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than
CC       24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute
CC       to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic
CC       syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL)
CC       forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism.
CC       Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 or ARNTL2/BMAL2,
CC       form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a
CC       heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and
CC       clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring
CC       E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock
CC       genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form
CC       the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the
CC       CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its
CC       activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This
CC       heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G,
CC       which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress
CC       ARNTL/BMAL1 transcription, respectively. Regulates the circadian
CC       expression of ICAM1, VCAM1, CCL2, THPO and MPL and also acts as an
CC       enhancer of the transactivation potential of NF-kappaB. Plays an
CC       important role in the homeostatic regulation of sleep. The CLOCK-
CC       ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer regulates the circadian expression of
CC       SERPINE1/PAI1, VWF, B3, CCRN4L/NOC, NAMPT, DBP, MYOD1, PPARGC1A,
CC       PPARGC1B, SIRT1, GYS2, F7, NGFR, GNRHR, BHLHE40/DEC1, ATF4, MTA1, KLF10
CC       and also genes implicated in glucose and lipid metabolism. Promotes
CC       rhythmic chromatin opening, regulating the DNA accessibility of other
CC       transcription factors. The CLOCK-ARNTL2/BMAL2 heterodimer activates the
CC       transcription of SERPINE1/PAI1 and BHLHE40/DEC1 (By similarity). The
CC       preferred binding motif for the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer is 5'-
CC       CACGTGA-3', which contains a flanking Ala residue in addition to the
CC       canonical 6-nucleotide E-box sequence (By similarity). CLOCK
CC       specifically binds to the half-site 5'-CAC-3', while ARNTL binds to the
CC       half-site 5'-GTGA-3' (By similarity). The CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer
CC       also recognizes the non-canonical E-box motifs 5'-AACGTGA-3' and 5'-
CC       CATGTGA-3'. CLOCK has an intrinsic acetyltransferase activity, which
CC       enables circadian chromatin remodeling by acetylating histones and
CC       nonhistone proteins, including its own partner ARNTL/BMAL1. Represses
CC       glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptional activity by
CC       reducing the association of NR3C1/GR to glucocorticoid response
CC       elements (GREs) via the acetylation of multiple lysine residues located
CC       in its hinge region. The acetyltransferase activity of CLOCK is as
CC       important as its transcription activity in circadian control.
CC       Acetylates metabolic enzymes IMPDH2 and NDUFA9 in a circadian manner.
CC       Facilitated by BMAL1, rhythmically interacts and acetylates
CC       argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) leading to enzymatic inhibition of
CC       ASS1 as well as the circadian oscillation of arginine biosynthesis and
CC       subsequent ureagenesis (By similarity). Drives the circadian rhythm of
CC       blood pressure through transcriptional activation of ATP1B1 (By
CC       similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O08785,

CC       heterodimer with ARNTL/BMAL1 (PubMed:11707566). The CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1
CC       heterodimer is required for E-box-dependent transactivation, for CLOCK
CC       nuclear translocation and degradation, and for phosphorylation of both
CC       CLOCK and ARNTL/BMAL1 (By similarity). Interacts with NR3C1 in a

CC       similarity). Interaction of the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 with CRY1 is

CC   -!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in brain, retina and harderian gland as

CC       protein degradation by inhibiting ubiquitination. It also stabilizes
CC       the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer thereby increasing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1-
CC       mediated transcriptional activation of PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2.

CC   -!- PTM: Phosphorylation is dependent on the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer
CC       formation. Phosphorylation enhances the transcriptional activity,
CC       alters the subcellular localization and decreases the stability of the
