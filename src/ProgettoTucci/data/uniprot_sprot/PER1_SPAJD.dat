CC   -!- FUNCTION: Transcriptional repressor which forms a core component of the
CC       circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system,
CC       regulates various physiological processes through the generation of
CC       approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are
CC       translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from
CC       the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an
CC       important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions
CC       including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure,
CC       endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two
CC       major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic
CC       nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present
CC       in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and
CC       peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as
CC       Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the
CC       central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly
CC       to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through
CC       neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related
CC       cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian
CC       rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its
CC       environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to
CC       create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when
CC       a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the
CC       solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components
CC       (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and
CC       CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays
CC       imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for
CC       determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period
CC       of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A
CC       diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the
CC       ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than
CC       24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute
CC       to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic
CC       syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL)
CC       forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism.
CC       Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 or ARNTL2/BMAL2,
CC       form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a
CC       heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and
CC       clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring
CC       E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock
CC       genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form
CC       the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the
CC       CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its
CC       activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This
CC       heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G,
CC       which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress
CC       ARNTL/BMAL1 transcription, respectively. Regulates circadian target
CC       genes expression at post-transcriptional levels, but may not be
CC       required for the repression at transcriptional level. Controls PER2
CC       protein decay. Represses CRY2 preventing its repression on CLOCK/ARNTL
CC       target genes such as FXYD5 and SCNN1A in kidney and PPARA in liver.
CC       Besides its involvement in the maintenance of the circadian clock, has
CC       an important function in the regulation of several processes.
CC       Participates in the repression of glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1/GR-
CC       induced transcriptional activity by reducing the association of
CC       NR3C1/GR to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) by ARNTL:CLOCK.
CC       Plays a role in the modulation of the neuroinflammatory state via the
CC       regulation of inflammatory mediators release, such as CCL2 and IL6. In
CC       spinal astrocytes, negatively regulates the MAPK14/p38 and MAPK8/JNK
CC       MAPK cascades as well as the subsequent activation of NFkappaB.
CC       Coordinately regulates the expression of multiple genes that are
CC       involved in the regulation of renal sodium reabsorption. Can act as
CC       gene expression activator in a gene and tissue specific manner, in
CC       kidney enhances WNK1 and SLC12A3 expression in collaboration with
CC       CLOCK. Modulates hair follicle cycling. Represses the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1
CC       induced transcription of BHLHE40/DEC1. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O35973}.
CC   -!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity). Component of the circadian core
CC       oscillator, which includes the CRY proteins, CLOCK or NPAS2,
CC       ARNTL/BMAL1 or ARNTL2/BMAL2, CSNK1D and/or CSNK1E, TIMELESS, and the
CC       PER proteins (By similarity). Interacts directly with TIMELESS, PER2,
CC       PER3, CRY1 and CRY2 (By similarity). Interacts with ARNTL/BMAL1 and
CC       CLOCK (By similarity). Interacts with GPRASP1 (By similarity).
CC       Interacts (phosphorylated) with BTRC and FBXW11; the interactions
CC       trigger proteasomal degradation (By similarity). Interacts with NONO,
CC       WDR5 and SFPQ (By similarity). Interacts with USP2 (By similarity).
CC       Interacts with HNF4A (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O15534,
CC       ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O35973, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8CHI5}.
CC   -!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus {ECO:0000250}. Cytoplasm {ECO:0000250}.
CC       Note=Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is effected by interaction with other
CC       circadian core oscillator proteins and/or by phosphorylation. Retention
CC       of PER1 in the cytoplasm occurs through PER1-PER2 heterodimer
CC       formation. Translocate to the nucleus after phosphorylation by CSNK1D
CC       or CSNK1E. Also translocated to the nucleus by CRY1 or CRY2 (By
CC       similarity). {ECO:0000250}.
CC   -!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in the brain, mainly in the
CC       suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Expression also found in the harderian
CC       gland, lung, eye, intestine, liver and skeletal muscle.
CC       {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12193657}.
CC   -!- INDUCTION: Exhibits circadian rhythm expression. In the SCN and
CC       harderian gland, maximum levels at ZT6. Maximum levels in the eye and
CC       liver at ZT12. Under constant darkness, maximum levels, in SCN and
