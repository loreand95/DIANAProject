CC   -!- FUNCTION: Nuclear transcriptional activator of viral gene expression,
CC       that is essential for viral transcription from the LTR promoter and
CC       replication. Acts as a sequence-specific molecular adapter, directing
CC       components of the cellular transcription machinery to the viral RNA to
CC       promote processive transcription elongation by the RNA polymerase II
CC       (RNA pol II) complex, thereby increasing the level of full-length
CC       transcripts. In the absence of Tat, the RNA Pol II generates short or
CC       non-processive transcripts that terminate at approximately 60 bp from
CC       the initiation site. Tat associates with the CCNT1/cyclin-T1 component
CC       of the P-TEFb complex (CDK9 and CCNT1), which promotes RNA chain
CC       elongation. This binding increases Tat's affinity for a hairpin
CC       structure at the 5'-end of all nascent viral mRNAs referred to as the
CC       transactivation responsive RNA element (TAR RNA) and allows Tat/P-TEFb
CC       complex to bind cooperatively to TAR RNA. The CDK9 component of P-TEFb
CC       and other Tat-activated kinases hyperphosphorylate the C-terminus of
CC       RNA Pol II that becomes stabilized and much more processive. Other
CC       factors such as HTATSF1/Tat-SF1, SUPT5H/SPT5, and HTATIP2 are also
CC       important for Tat's function. Besides its effect on RNA Pol II
CC       processivity, Tat induces chromatin remodeling of proviral genes by
CC       recruiting the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) CREBBP, EP300 and PCAF
CC       to the chromatin. This also contributes to the increase in proviral
CC       transcription rate, especially when the provirus integrates in
CC       transcriptionally silent region of the host genome. To ensure maximal
CC       activation of the LTR, Tat mediates nuclear translocation of NF-kappa-B
CC       by interacting with host RELA. Through its interaction with host TBP,
CC       Tat may also modulate transcription initiation. Tat can reactivate a
CC       latently infected cell by penetrating in it and transactivating its LTR
CC       promoter. In the cytoplasm, Tat is thought to act as a translational
CC       activator of HIV-1 mRNAs. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04079}.
CC   -!- FUNCTION: Extracellular circulating Tat can be endocytosed by
CC       surrounding uninfected cells via the binding to several surface
CC       receptors such as CD26, CXCR4, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) or
CC       LDLR. Neurons are rarely infected, but they internalize Tat via their
CC       LDLR. Through its interaction with nuclear HATs, Tat is potentially
CC       able to control the acetylation-dependent cellular gene expression.
CC       Modulates the expression of many cellular genes involved in cell
CC       survival, proliferation or in coding for cytokines or cytokine
CC       receptors. Tat plays a role in T-cell and neurons apoptosis. Tat
CC       induced neurotoxicity and apoptosis probably contribute to neuroAIDS.
CC       Circulating Tat also acts as a chemokine-like and/or growth factor-like
CC       molecule that binds to specific receptors on the surface of the cells,
CC       affecting many cellular pathways. In the vascular system, Tat binds to
CC       ITGAV/ITGB3 and ITGA5/ITGB1 integrins dimers at the surface of
CC       endothelial cells and competes with bFGF for heparin-binding sites,
CC       leading to an excess of soluble bFGF. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-
CC       Rule:MF_04079}.
CC   -!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with host CCNT1. Associates with the P-TEFb complex
CC       composed at least of Tat, P-TEFb (CDK9 and CCNT1), TAR RNA, RNA Pol II.
CC       Recruits the HATs CREBBP, TAF1/TFIID, EP300, PCAF and GCN5L2. Interacts
CC       with host KAT5/Tip60; this interaction targets the latter to
CC       degradation. Interacts with the host deacetylase SIRT1. Interacts with
CC       host capping enzyme RNGTT; this interaction stimulates RNGTT. Binds to
CC       host KDR, and to the host integrins ITGAV/ITGB3 and ITGA5/ITGB1.
CC       Interacts with host KPNB1/importin beta-1 without previous binding to
CC       KPNA1/importin alpha-1. Interacts with EIF2AK2. Interacts with host
CC       nucleosome assembly protein NAP1L1; this interaction may be required
CC       for the transport of Tat within the nucleus, since the two proteins
CC       interact at the nuclear rim. Interacts with host C1QBP/SF2P32; this
CC       interaction involves lysine-acetylated Tat. Interacts with the host
CC       chemokine receptors CCR2, CCR3 and CXCR4. Interacts with host
CC       DPP4/CD26; this interaction may trigger an anti-proliferative effect.
CC       Interacts with host LDLR. Interacts with the host extracellular matrix
CC       metalloproteinase MMP1. Interacts with host PRMT6; this interaction
CC       mediates Tat's methylation. Interacts with, and is ubiquitinated by
CC       MDM2/Hdm2. Interacts with host PSMC3 and HTATIP2. Interacts with STAB1;
CC       this interaction may overcome SATB1-mediated repression of IL2 and
CC       IL2RA (interleukin) in T cells by binding to the same domain than
CC       HDAC1. Interacts (when acetylated) with human CDK13, thereby increasing
CC       HIV-1 mRNA splicing and promoting the production of the doubly spliced
CC       HIV-1 protein Nef.Interacts with host TBP; this interaction modulates
CC       the activity of transcriptional pre-initiation complex. Interacts with
CC       host RELA. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04079}.
CC   -!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Host nucleus, host nucleolus {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-
CC       Rule:MF_04079}. Host cytoplasm {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04079}.
CC       Secreted {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04079}. Note=Probably localizes to
CC       both nuclear and nucleolar compartments. Nuclear localization is
CC       mediated through the interaction of the nuclear localization signal
CC       with importin KPNB1. Secretion occurs through a Golgi-independent
CC       pathway. Tat is released from infected cells to the extracellular space
CC       where it remains associated to the cell membrane, or is secreted into
CC       the cerebrospinal fluid and sera. Extracellular Tat can be endocytosed
CC       by surrounding uninfected cells via binding to several receptors
CC       depending on the cell type. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04079}.

CC   -!- DOMAIN: The cell attachment site mediates the interaction with
CC       ITGAV/ITGB3 and ITGA5/ITGB1 integrins, leading to vascular cell
CC       migration and invasion. This interaction also provides endothelial
CC       cells with the adhesion signal they require to grow in response to
CC       mitogens. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04079}.
CC   -!- DOMAIN: The Cys-rich region may bind 2 zinc ions. This region is
CC       involved in binding to KAT5. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04079}.
CC   -!- DOMAIN: The transactivation domain mediates the interaction with CCNT1,
CC       GCN5L2, and MDM2. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04079}.
CC   -!- DOMAIN: The Arg-rich RNA-binding region binds the TAR RNA. This region
CC       also mediates the nuclear localization through direct binding to KPNB1
CC       and is involved in Tat's transfer across cell membranes (protein
CC       transduction). The same region is required for the interaction with
CC       EP300, PCAF, EIF2AK2 and KDR.
CC   -!- PTM: Asymmetrical arginine methylation by host PRMT6 seems to diminish
CC       the transactivation capacity of Tat and affects the interaction with
CC       host CCNT1. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04079}.
CC   -!- PTM: Acetylation by EP300, CREBBP, GCN5L2/GCN5 and PCAF regulates the
CC       transactivation activity of Tat. EP300-mediated acetylation of Lys-50
CC       promotes dissociation of Tat from the TAR RNA through the competitive
CC       binding to PCAF's bromodomain. In addition, the non-acetylated Tat's N-
CC       terminus can also interact with PCAF. PCAF-mediated acetylation of Lys-
CC       28 enhances Tat's binding to CCNT1. Lys-50 is deacetylated by SIRT1.
CC       {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04079}.
CC   -!- PTM: Polyubiquitination by host MDM2 does not target Tat to
CC       degradation, but activates its transactivation function and fosters
CC       interaction with CCNT1 and TAR RNA. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04079}.
CC   -!- PTM: Phosphorylated by EIF2AK2 on serine and threonine residues
CC       adjacent to the basic region important for TAR RNA binding and
CC       function. Phosphorylation of Tat by EIF2AK2 is dependent on the prior
CC       activation of EIF2AK2 by dsRNA. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04079}.
CC   -!- MISCELLANEOUS: This truncated variant has a premature stop codon. It
CC       may have arose as a consequence of tissue culture passaging.
CC       {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04079}.
CC   -!- MISCELLANEOUS: HIV-1 lineages are divided in three main groups, M (for
CC       Major), O (for Outlier), and N (for New, or Non-M, Non-O). The vast
CC       majority of strains found worldwide belong to the group M. Group O
CC       seems to be endemic to and largely confined to Cameroon and neighboring
CC       countries in West Central Africa, where these viruses represent a small
CC       minority of HIV-1 strains. The group N is represented by a limited
CC       number of isolates from Cameroonian persons. The group M is further
CC       subdivided in 9 clades or subtypes (A to D, F to H, J and K).
CC       {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04079}.
CC   -!- MISCELLANEOUS: [Isoform Short]: Expressed in the late stage of the
CC       infection cycle, when unspliced viral RNAs are exported to the
CC       cytoplasm by the viral Rev protein. {ECO:0000305}.
CC   -!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the lentiviruses Tat family. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-
CC       Rule:MF_04079}.
