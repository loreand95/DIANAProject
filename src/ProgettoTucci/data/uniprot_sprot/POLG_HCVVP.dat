CC   -!- FUNCTION: [Mature core protein]: Packages viral RNA to form a viral
CC       nucleocapsid, and promotes virion budding (Probable). Participates in
CC       the viral particle production as a result of its interaction with the
CC       non-structural protein 5A (By similarity). Binds RNA and may function
CC       as a RNA chaperone to induce the RNA structural rearrangements taking
CC       place during virus replication (By similarity). Modulates viral
CC       translation initiation by interacting with viral IRES and 40S ribosomal
CC       subunit (By similarity). Affects various cell signaling pathways, host
CC       immunity and lipid metabolism (Probable). Prevents the establishment of
CC       cellular antiviral state by blocking the interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-
CC       alpha/beta) and IFN-gamma signaling pathways and by blocking the
CC       formation of phosphorylated STAT1 and promoting ubiquitin-mediated
CC       proteasome-dependent degradation of STAT1 (By similarity). Activates
CC       STAT3 leading to cellular transformation (By similarity). Regulates the
CC       activity of cellular genes, including c-myc and c-fos (By similarity).
CC       May repress the promoter of p53, and sequester CREB3 and SP110 isoform
CC       3/Sp110b in the cytoplasm (By similarity). Represses cell cycle
CC       negative regulating factor CDKN1A, thereby interrupting an important
CC       check point of normal cell cycle regulation (By similarity). Targets
CC       transcription factors involved in the regulation of inflammatory
CC       responses and in the immune response: suppresses TNF-induced NF-kappa-B
CC       activation, and activates AP-1 (By similarity). Binds to dendritic
CC       cells (DCs) via C1QR1, resulting in down-regulation of T-lymphocytes
CC       proliferation (By similarity). Alters lipid metabolism by interacting
CC       with hepatocellular proteins involved in lipid accumulation and storage
CC       (By similarity). Induces up-regulation of FAS promoter activity, and
CC       thereby contributes to the increased triglyceride accumulation in
CC       hepatocytes (steatosis) (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P26662,

CC   -!- FUNCTION: [Envelope glycoprotein E1]: Forms a heterodimer with envelope
CC       glycoprotein E2, which mediates virus attachment to the host cell,
CC       virion internalization through clathrin-dependent endocytosis and
CC       fusion with host membrane (By similarity). Fusion with the host cell is
CC       most likely mediated by both E1 and E2, through conformational
CC       rearrangements of the heterodimer required for fusion rather than a
CC       classical class II fusion mechanism (By similarity). E1/E2 heterodimer
CC       binds host apolipoproteins such as APOB and ApoE thereby forming a
CC       lipo-viro-particle (LVP) (By similarity). APOE associated to the LVP
CC       allows the initial virus attachment to cell surface receptors such as
CC       the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), syndecan-1 (SDC1), syndecan-
CC       1 (SDC2), the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and scavenger
CC       receptor class B type I (SCARB1) (By similarity). The cholesterol
CC       transfer activity of SCARB1 allows E2 exposure and binding of E2 to
CC       SCARB1 and the tetraspanin CD81 (By similarity). E1/E2 heterodimer
CC       binding on CD81 activates the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR)
CC       signaling pathway (By similarity). Diffusion of the complex E1-E2-EGFR-
CC       SCARB1-CD81 to the cell lateral membrane allows further interaction
CC       with Claudin 1 (CLDN1) and occludin (OCLN) to finally trigger HCV entry
CC       (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P27958}.
CC   -!- FUNCTION: [Envelope glycoprotein E2]: Forms a heterodimer with envelope
CC       glycoprotein E1, which mediates virus attachment to the host cell,
CC       virion internalization through clathrin-dependent endocytosis and
CC       fusion with host membrane (By similarity). Fusion with the host cell is
CC       most likely mediated by both E1 and E2, through conformational
CC       rearrangements of the heterodimer required for fusion rather than a
CC       classical class II fusion mechanism (By similarity). The interaction
CC       between envelope glycoprotein E2 and host apolipoprotein E/APOE allows
CC       the proper assembly, maturation and infectivity of the viral particles
CC       (By similarity). This interaction is probably promoted via the up-
CC       regulation of cellular autophagy by the virus (By similarity). E1/E2
CC       heterodimer binds host apolipoproteins such as APOB and APOE thereby
CC       forming a lipo-viro-particle (LVP) (By similarity). APOE associated to
CC       the LVP allows the initial virus attachment to cell surface receptors
CC       such as the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), syndecan-1 (SDC1),
CC       syndecan-1 (SDC2), the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and
CC       scavenger receptor class B type I (SCARB1) (By similarity). The
CC       cholesterol transfer activity of SCARB1 allows E2 exposure and binding
CC       of E2 to SCARB1 and the tetraspanin CD81 (By similarity). E1/E2
CC       heterodimer binding on CD81 activates the epithelial growth factor
CC       receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway (By similarity). Diffusion of the
CC       complex E1-E2-EGFR-SCARB1-CD81 to the cell lateral membrane allows
CC       further interaction with Claudin 1 (CLDN1) and occludin (OCLN) to
CC       finally trigger HCV entry (By similarity). Inhibits host EIF2AK2/PKR
CC       activation, preventing the establishment of an antiviral state (By
CC       similarity). Viral ligand for CD209/DC-SIGN and CLEC4M/DC-SIGNR, which
CC       are respectively found on dendritic cells (DCs), and on liver
CC       sinusoidal endothelial cells and macrophage-like cells of lymph node
CC       sinuses (By similarity). These interactions allow the capture of
CC       circulating HCV particles by these cells and subsequent facilitated
CC       transmission to permissive cells such as hepatocytes and lymphocyte
CC       subpopulations (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P26664,
CC       ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P27958}.
CC   -!- FUNCTION: [Viroporin p7]: Ion channel protein that acts as a viroporin
CC       and plays an essential role in the assembly, envelopment and secretion
CC       of viral particles (By similarity). Regulates the host cell secretory
CC       pathway, which induces the intracellular retention of viral
CC       glycoproteins and favors assembly of viral particles (By similarity).
CC       Creates a pore in acidic organelles and releases Ca(2+) and H(+) in the
CC       cytoplasm of infected cells, leading to a productive viral infection
CC       (By similarity). High levels of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) may trigger membrane
CC       trafficking and transport of viral ER-associated proteins to
CC       viroplasms, sites of viral genome replication (Probable). This ionic
CC       imbalance induces the assembly of the inflammasome complex, which
CC       triggers the maturation of pro-IL-1beta into IL-1beta through the
CC       action of caspase-1 (By similarity). Targets also host mitochondria and
CC       induces mitochondrial depolarization (By similarity). In addition of
CC       its role as a viroporin, acts as a lipid raft adhesion factor (By
CC       similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P27958,
CC       ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q99IB8, ECO:0000305}.
CC   -!- FUNCTION: [Protease NS2]: Cysteine protease required for the
CC       proteolytic auto-cleavage between the non-structural proteins NS2 and
CC       NS3 (By similarity). The N-terminus of NS3 is required for the function
CC       of NS2 protease (active region NS2-3) (By similarity). Promotes the
CC       initiation of viral particle assembly by mediating the interaction
CC       between structural and non-structural proteins (By similarity).
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P26663, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P27958}.
CC   -!- FUNCTION: [Serine protease/helicase NS3]: Displays three enzymatic
CC       activities: serine protease with a chymotrypsin-like fold, NTPase and
CC       RNA helicase (By similarity). NS3 serine protease, in association with
CC       NS4A, is responsible for the cleavages of NS3-NS4A, NS4A-NS4B, NS4B-
CC       NS5A and NS5A-NS5B (By similarity). The NS3/NS4A complex prevents
CC       phosphorylation of host IRF3, thus preventing the establishment of
CC       dsRNA induced antiviral state (By similarity). NS3 RNA helicase binds
CC       to RNA and unwinds both dsDNA and dsRNA in the 3' to 5' direction, and
CC       likely resolves RNA complicated stable secondary structures in the
CC       template strand (By similarity). Binds a single ATP and catalyzes the
CC       unzipping of a single base pair of dsRNA (By similarity). Inhibits host
CC       antiviral proteins TBK1 and IRF3 thereby preventing the establishment
CC       of an antiviral state (By similarity). Cleaves host MAVS/CARDIF thereby
CC       preventing the establishment of an antiviral state (By similarity).
CC       Cleaves host TICAM1/TRIF, thereby disrupting TLR3 signaling and
CC       preventing the establishment of an antiviral state (By similarity).
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P27958, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9WMX2}.
CC   -!- FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4B]: Induces a specific membrane
CC       alteration that serves as a scaffold for the virus replication complex
CC       (By similarity). This membrane alteration gives rise to the so-called
CC       ER-derived membranous web that contains the replication complex (By
CC       similarity). NS4B self-interaction contributes to its function in
CC       membranous web formation (By similarity). Promotes host TRIF protein
CC       degradation in a CASP8-dependent manner thereby inhibiting host TLR3-
CC       mediated interferon signaling (By similarity). Disrupts the interaction
CC       between STING and TBK1 contributing to the inhibition of interferon
CC       signaling (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P27958}.
CC   -!- FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 5A]: Phosphorylated protein that is
CC       indispensable for viral replication and assembly (By similarity). Both
CC       hypo- and hyperphosphorylated states are required for the viral life
CC       cycle (By similarity). The hyperphosphorylated form of NS5A is an
CC       inhibitor of viral replication (By similarity). Involved in RNA-binding
CC       and especially in binding to the viral genome (By similarity). Zinc is
CC       essential for RNA-binding (By similarity). Participates in the viral
CC       particle production as a result of its interaction with the mature
CC       viral core protein (By similarity). Its interaction with host VAPB may
CC       target the viral replication complex to vesicles (By similarity). Down-
CC       regulates viral IRES translation initiation (By similarity). Mediates
CC       interferon resistance, presumably by interacting with and inhibiting
CC       host EIF2AK2/PKR (By similarity). Prevents BIN1-induced apoptosis (By
CC       similarity). Acts as a transcriptional activator of some host genes
CC       important for viral replication when localized in the nucleus (By
CC       similarity). Via the interaction with host PACSIN2, modulates lipid
CC       droplet formation in order to promote virion assembly (By similarity).
CC       Modulates TNFRSF21/DR6 signaling pathway for viral propagation (By
CC       similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P26662,

CC       associates with E1/E2 glycoproteins, NS3 and NS5A, which interacts with

CC       nucleocapsid buds at the ER membrane where E1/E2 glycoproteins are
CC       anchored and afterward associate with nascent lipid droplet to acquire
CC       APOE and APOC. Secretion of viral particles is probably regulated by
CC       viroporin p7. {ECO:0000305}.
CC   -!- MISCELLANEOUS: [Non-structural protein 5A]: Cell culture adaptation of
CC       the virus leads to mutations in NS5A, reducing its inhibitory effect on
CC       replication. {ECO:0000305}.
CC   -!- MISCELLANEOUS: [Mature core protein]: Exerts viral interference on
CC       hepatitis B virus when HCV and HBV coinfect the same cell, by
CC       suppressing HBV gene expression, RNA encapsidation and budding.
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P26662}.
CC   -!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the hepacivirus polyprotein family.
CC       {ECO:0000305}.
CC   -!- CAUTION: The core gene probably also codes for alternative reading
CC       frame proteins (ARFPs). Many functions depicted for the core protein
CC       might belong to the ARFPs. {ECO:0000305}.
CC   -!- CAUTION: Lacks the conserved His residue in position 1084 essential for
CC       serine protease NS3 activity. Its enzyme activity is therefore unsure.
CC       {ECO:0000305}.
