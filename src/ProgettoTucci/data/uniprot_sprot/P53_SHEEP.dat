CC   -!- FUNCTION: Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces
CC       growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances
CC       and cell type. Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator
CC       that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of
CC       genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an
CC       inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be
CC       mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by
CC       repression of Bcl-2 expression. Its pro-apoptotic activity is activated
CC       via its interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 (By
CC       similarity). However, this activity is inhibited when the interaction
CC       with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 is displaced by PPP1R13L/iASPP (By
CC       similarity). In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in
CC       activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely
CC       independent of transcription. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when
CC       associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell
CC       cycle progression. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-
CC       coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21
CC       participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to
CC       apoptosis and seems to have an effect on cell-cycle regulation.
CC       Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1-mediated
CC       transcriptional activation of PER2. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P02340,

CC       p53/TP53 that are not targeted to the proteasome. Ubiquitinated by
CC       MKRN1, which leads to proteasomal degradation. Deubiquitinated by
