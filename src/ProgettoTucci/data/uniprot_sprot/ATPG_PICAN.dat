CC   -!- FUNCTION: Mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or
CC       Complex V) produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient
CC       across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes
CC       of the respiratory chain (PubMed:25759169). F-type ATP synthases
CC       consist of two structural domains, F(1) - containing the
CC       extramembraneous catalytic core, and F(0) - containing the membrane
CC       proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral
CC       stalk (PubMed:27791192). During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the
CC       catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the
CC       central stalk subunits to proton translocation (By similarity). Part of
CC       the complex F(1) domain and the central stalk which is part of the
CC       complex rotary element (By similarity). The gamma/ATP3 subunit
CC       protrudes into the catalytic domain formed of alpha/ATP1(3)beta/ATP2(3)
CC       (By similarity). Rotation of the central stalk against the surrounding
CC       alpha/ATP1(3)beta/ATP2(3) subunits leads to hydrolysis of ATP in three
CC       separate catalytic sites on the beta/ATP2 subunits (By similarity).
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q6C338, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25759169,
CC       ECO:0000269|PubMed:27791192}.
CC   -!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATP synthases have 2 components, the catalytic core
CC       F(1) and the membrane-embedded component F(0), linked together by a
CC       central stalk and a peripheral stalk (PubMed:27791192). The central
CC       stalk, also called rotor shaft, is often seen as part of F(1)
CC       (PubMed:27791192). The peripheral stalk is seen as part of F(0). F(0)
CC       contains the membrane channel next to the rotor (PubMed:27791192). F-
CC       type ATP synthases form dimers but each monomer functions independently
CC       in ATP generation (By similarity). The dimer consists of 18 different
CC       polypeptides: ATP1 (subunit alpha, part of F(1), 3 molecules per
CC       monomer), ATP2 (subunit beta, part of F(1), 3 molecules per monomer),
CC       ATP3 (subunit gamma, part of the central stalk), ATP4 (subunit b, part
CC       of the peripheral stalk), ATP5/OSCP (subunit 5/OSCP, part of the
CC       peripheral stalk), ATP6 (subunit a, part of the peripheral stalk), ATP7
CC       (subunit d, part of the peripheral stalk), ATP8 (subunit 8, part of the
CC       peripheral stalk), OLI1 (subunit c, part of the rotor, 10 molecules per
CC       monomer), ATP14 (subunit h, part of the peripheral stalk), ATP15
CC       (subunit epsilon, part of the central stalk), ATP16 (subunit delta,
CC       part of the central stalk), ATP17 (subunit f, part of the peripheral
CC       stalk), ATP18 (subunit i/j, part of the peripheral stalk)
CC       (PubMed:27791192, PubMed:25759169). Dimer-specific subunits are ATP19
CC       (subunit k, at interface between monomers), ATP20 (subunit g, at
CC       interface between monomers), TIM11 (subunit e, at interface between
CC       monomers) (By similarity). Also contains subunit L (PubMed:25759169).

CC       {ECO:0000305|PubMed:27791192}. Note=The F-type ATP synthase complex is
CC       anchored in the mitochondrial inner membrane via the F(0) domain with
CC       the F(1) domain and the peripheral stalk extending into the
CC       mitochondrial matrix. {ECO:0000305|PubMed:27791192}.
